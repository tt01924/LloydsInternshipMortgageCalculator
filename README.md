**As the client:**
- Improvment on the usability and intuitivity of the tool.
- Clear readability.
- Heterogenous; Calculator can function across all screen sizes and platforms.
- Object orient program so bug fixes and different components are clear.

## Tools Used

The site is written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## If I had more time...
- Build a database to store users information and inputs.
- Proivde tooltips and screen reader functionality for users who require further intuition.
- Adapt the colour palette to fit in-line with Lloyds colour scheme.

## To use in your code editor:
- Ensure node & node package manager are installed.
- Install web vitals with terminal command 'npm install web-vitals'.
- Finally run 'npm start' in your terminal to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
